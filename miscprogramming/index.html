            <h1>Miscellaneous Programming</h1>
            <p>Apart from more organized lines of work, I have a bunch of side projects that I like to mess around with. You can find some of the more practical ones here.</p>

                <h2>Reddit Sheets</h2>
                <p>Reddit Sheets is a Reddit client built to run in Google Sheets using multiple different API interactions through a Python script. It was conceived when I wanted a good unblocked Reddit client for school use, but I also wanted it to be 1) easily disguised and 2) future-proof.</p>
                <p>Unfortunately, since Reddit Sheets uses both the Reddit and Google APIs, both of which have request limits (and would give you basic access to my account), I cannot just go around giving away a link to the sheets page willy-nilly. However, if you would like to set this up for yourself, you can find the source code <a href="https://github.com/EmuMan/reddit-sheets" target="_blank">here</a>. There are also instructions to help you get started (well there aren't any now but there will be soon).</p>

                <h2>Blender MIDI Utils</h2>
                <p>If you've ever heard of Animusic, you probably have a pretty good idea of what this does. It basically allows you to take MIDI input and convert it into Blender keyframes, allowing you to easily create Animusic-like animations. Here is a small <a href="https://youtu.be/Duti3pvmtCU" target="_blank">demo</a> showcasing its capabilities as of now (admittedly not much, but I'm working on it).</p>
                <p>If you want to try it out for yourself, you can find the source code and documentation <a href="https://github.com/EmuMan/blender-midi-utils">here</a>.</p>

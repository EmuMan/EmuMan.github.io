            <h2>What is Songtober?</h2>
            <p>Songtober is a sort of challenge based off of the popular informal drawing event, Inktober. In the case of Inktober, for every day of October, there is a new prompt that should be drawn by whoever is participating. You can read more about it <a href="https://inktober.com/">here</a>. When one of my friends shared the 2020 prompt list, since I can't draw, I had the idea to do the challenge but with music instead of drawing. And thus Songtober was born.</p>
            <p>Just as a side note, I am sure I am not the first to come up with this idea, but I have also never really seen anyone else do it, so for me it's a new concept. Enjoy my musical interpretations of these prompts.</p>

                    <td style="width: 100%;">The main feature of this is the kind of arpeggiated chords in the background through the whole thing. I was kind of going for a "bloop" sound, and it sorta worked I guess? The wah-sounding thing at the beginning was supposed to be a little fishy as well, I donâ€™t know why I made that correlation but hey I tried. The bells at the end were supposed to be underwater-y and smooth and stuff. I also drowned the whole thing in reverb (maybe a bit too much) and cut a lot of the high frequencies to add a little bit to the underwater feel.</td>

                    <td style="width: 100%;">This one is more of a soundscape than anything, which is kinda cool I guess. It's like the song you'd expect to hear when you encounter a mysterious floating glow-y smoke-y thing in the woods at night or something. I used a whole tone scale to try to convey a sort of fantasy vibe for the whole thing. I actually based this off of an old sample I found of a vocal thing that I re-tuned to a single note and then put a crap ton of reverb on. I ran it through some granular synthesis, which is basically playing the sample from different points randomly to create like a whole bunch of the sound but all at different points in time, and then I played it really low and yeah. I hadn't really touched granular synthesis so it was pretty fun. The rest is mostly just ambient wind and chime noise I got off of a website and some extra noise to make the lead sound more breath-y.</td>

                    <td style="width: 100%;">My first thought was basically that this bass would sound pretty bulky (in my eyes), so I kinda formed everything else around it. It turned out more sneaky than I would have liked, although it still has some of that chunky quality I think. Maybe something bulky sneaking around? I don't know. Other than that I'm actually okay with how it turned out. Also sorry if the bass is too loud or quiet, it's pretty headphone-dependent unfortunately and I went on the louder side.</td>

                    <td style="width: 100%;">So the first thing I thought of when I heard "radio" was a sort of sampled lo-fi, retro aesthetic, but like, crunchier. So I kinda went with that here, and it worked out I think. The voice is from <a href="https://youtu.be/bZe5J8SVCYQ">this video</a> that I happened to remember.</td>

                    <td style="width: 100%;">For this one I basically downloaded a few different sword sounds and used some percussion loops both from libraries and mine to create the kind of tribal groove going on behind. I also thought it got a little boring near the middle so I decided to add some dramatic orchestra parts to increase the energy. Not terribly well mixed, but oh well.</td>

                    <td style="width: 100%;">I had been thinking about it for a while. I mean how in the world am I supposed to make a song about rodents??? So I basically just took a kinda squeak-sounding lead and a fast-paced tempo to indicate something scurrying around, maybe running away from something, and went from there. And now I regret everything. I'm also fairly certain that I just completely copied the melody of some other random song out there. Either that or this is the most generic cartoon-y chase music ever written.</td>

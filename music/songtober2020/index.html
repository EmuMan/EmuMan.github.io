            <h2>What is Songtober?</h2>
            <p>Songtober is a sort of challenge based off of the popular informal drawing event, Inktober. In the case of Inktober, for every day of October, there is a new prompt that should be drawn by whoever is participating. You can read more about it <a href="https://inktober.com/">here</a>. When one of my friends shared the 2020 prompt list, since I can't draw, I had the idea to do the challenge but with music instead of drawing. And thus Songtober was born.</p>
            <p>Just as a side note, I am sure I am not the first to come up with this idea, but I have also never really seen anyone else do it, so for me it's a new concept. Enjoy my musical interpretations of these prompts.</p>
